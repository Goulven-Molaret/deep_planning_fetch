# Applied trajectory prediction framework for fetch robot  :monkey_face:

This project intend to develop the tools to evaluate the possibility of a deep learning framework to generate initial trajectory for motion planning algorithm

## Introduction
This project tackles the problems of motion planning in a complex environment for the fetch robot.

The following tools are present in this repository and together form the framework:
 
 1. Generate a dataset        --> Dataset Generator
 2. Compress dataset          --> Compressing tool
 3. Train Generator model     --> Generator trainers
 4. Performance evalutation   --> Metric tools
 5. Visualize results         --> Visualisation tools
